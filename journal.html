                <h3>Jehovah Rapha - December 15, 2025</h3>
                <p> I'm not sure when,if it was Friday or Saturday or even on the way to the hospital, but Jehovah Rapha came to my mind and I didn't even know what that meant until I looked it up this morning. :D
                    'Jehovah Rapha (or Rophe) means "The Lord who Heals" or "The God who Heals," combining the Hebrew names "Jehovah" (The Existing One/Lord) and "Rapha" (to mend, repair, or restore). It signifies God's power to provide wholeness, not just physically, but also emotionally, mentally, and spiritually, fixing brokenness and making things whole, a concept fulfilled in Jesus Christ, the Great Physician'
                    It has been an eventful month 🤭🤭🤭.  On Sunday, Nov 23 I thought I had a kidney stone that was passing. I decided to wait it out since I have had one in the past, 2016. However, by Tuesday I wasn't getting any better and my sister-in-law called me as I was leaving a health service facility.(I was checking on my medi-cal application since I have been unemployed for some time now 😭) I was debating about going to the emergency room or going back home and sleeping but my sister in law insisted I go to the emg and had my brother come pick me up. Kyle came and we were at urgent care around 1p and by 3pm, after a CT, we found out my appendix reptured. At 5 or so, I was emitted to a hospital. Wednesday, around 1p I had a drain bag attached to me to get the pus and other stuff flow of of me instead of having it drain inside my body. I stayed another full day (Thursday). Friday, the drain was still pretty empty so they decided to remove it, discharge me, and send me home with antibotics. (dude, watch out for those drain bags when they pull them out!! They can be 🌶🌶🌶) They told me the general surgeon would call within a couple of days to see how I was doing to discuss the next action.  However, no one from the hospital called me or did a follow up. I could tell I was getting worse because each night I had more pain (7th, 8th, & 9th) So I called them on Dec 10th to make an appt and had scheduled it for the following day, the 11th (thur). However, my mom wasn't able to take me so we rescheduled for Monday the 15th. On Thursday, I decided to fast and stick with liquids to see if that would help my stomch and intestines.  I was doing great until I drank a mango madness and ate 1/2 an orange. (lay off the thick drinks folks!!! stick with clear fluids when u have appendix issues.) Within 1/2 an hour I was on the toilet letting it all flow out and my strength left me. I could feel the darkness over coming me and I thought for sure I was going to faint. I was able to wobble my way to the sink were I threw up entire my life.  Good Times!!🤪 I am so lucky I had my cell phone next to me. Unforuantly, it is only used for wifi, no sim, but I was able to msg my family to let them know i needed to go to the hosiptal asap. My brother picked me up and we went to the closest emg in the area.  We were less than 0.5 miles, when the suv broke down. (This car has NEVER broken down, it is reliable, never had issues!! 😈) But God was watching out for me and compelled a beautiful soul to do a u-turn to help us out. She actually said, she had this feeling/urge to come over and help us.. something along those lines. (May the God of Abraham, Issac, and Jacob Bless her Richly!!!) She took me to the hospital and went back to help my brother. My parents met up with me at the emg hospital and told me that 3 other people came to the help of my brother. One was a mechanic that told my brother what part needed to be replaced. I don't know who the 3rd person was but the 4th person was someone who was a little buzzed. 😂😂😂 I thought that was pretty funny that even a person under the influence tried to help us. 🙌 I had another CT scan and the Dr said that the bacteria had formed around the hole of the appendix and that I had to go back to the hospital. 😐 so around 2am Friday, I arrived at a different hospital. Had a CT scan at 5pm and that Dr recommened another drain bag 😫. Saturday morning, I think, they attached one on me. Sunday, another CT scan was done, the bacteria was gone and they removed the bag after giving me nanic? [i'll fix this post later w/ correct name]. By 430? I was discharged and now I have IV meds through a midline that I am to have once a day 🤗. In a month or two, my appendix will be removed 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳.
                    I do have prayer requests: There is an older gentleman I met at the emg rm before going to the hospital, please pray for him and his son who drove him there. There were 3 different paitents that roomed w/ me while at the hosptial: one w/ a gal bladder issue, another one with appenix, and the third with hip pain. Please pray for them. Also, one of the transports has two kids in their teens who live with their mom that isn't a Christian. They stopped going to church a couple of years ago and seem to not believe in Jesus as The Messiah.
                    I want to especially thank all the prayer warriors who are aware of my situation and The Baptist deacon/pastor who spoke with my parents, that he would pray for me: Much Love, that really was a comfort to hear that. 🥰💞

                <h3>dream - December 14, 2025</h3>
                <p> 
                    I had a pretty cool dream this morning. It was very brief. It was completely black background with no light and then white brilliant Hewbrew letters started appearing, as if someone was writing them but there wasnt any hands or anything. and someone, a man, was teaching me how to pronounce the words and was speaking to me in hebrew. I was in the spirit watching and listening and suddenly cracked a joke within myself: "the jew haters are going to lose their mind if this is going to be taught to everyone" and then I was taken out of that dream and woke up. I thought that was a pretty cool. Words I haven't learned yet.

                <h3>dream - November 23, 2025</h3>
                <p> 
                    I had a dream that I was holding a hand granade in my right hand and some how it was activitated. I don't know if it malfunctioned or if I accidentally set it off but I was in a panic to try and figure out how to deactivate it. [I was switching between 1st person and 3d pesron.] I could see myself going through the house trying to find a place where I could put it to minimize the explosion and as I went back outside the garage, there was storm lying down on the garage floor passively wathing me, no concern. Her heard was up staring at me and I was so surprised to see her but since I still had the granade in my hand that I couldnt visit with her. (By this time the granade had morphed into some odd structure.) There was this steal little box by the front door steps that I put the explosive device in.  However, when it went off, the thing imploded on itself and then I woke up with really bad pain on my right side of my lower body. It felt like a kidney stone that was stuck.
