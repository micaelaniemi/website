                <h3>Jehovah Rapha - December 15, 2025</h3>
                <p> I'm not sure when—if it was Friday or Saturday or even on the way to the hospital—but Jehovah Rapha came to my mind, and I didn't even know what that meant until I looked it up this morning. :D
'Jehovah Rapha (or Rophe) means "The Lord who Heals" or "The God who Heals," combining the Hebrew names "Jehovah" (The Existing One/Lord) and "Rapha" (to mend, repair, or restore). It signifies God's power to provide wholeness, not just physically, but also emotionally, mentally, and spiritually, fixing brokenness and making things whole, a concept fulfilled in Jesus Christ, the Great Physician.'
It has been an eventful month 🤭🤭🤭. On Sunday, Nov 23 I thought I had a kidney stone that was passing. I decided to wait it out since I have had one in the past, 2016. However, by Tuesday I wasn't getting any better and my sister-in-law called me as I was leaving a health service facility. (I was checking on my Medi-Cal application since I have been unemployed for some time now 😭) I was debating about going to the emergency room or going back home and sleeping, but my sister-in-law insisted I go to the ER and had my brother come pick me up. Kyle came and we were at urgent care around 1p and by 3pm, after a CT, we found out my appendix had ruptured. At 5 or so, I was admitted to a hospital. Wednesday, around 1p I had a drain bag attached to me to get the pus and other stuff to flow out of me instead of having it drain inside my body. I stayed another full day (Thursday). Friday, the drain was still pretty empty so they decided to remove it, discharge me, and send me home with antibiotics. (Dude, watch out for those drain bags when they pull them out!! They can be 🌶🌶🌶) They told me the general surgeon would call within a couple of days to see how I was doing to discuss the next action. However, no one from the hospital called me or did a follow-up. I could tell I was getting worse because each night I had more pain (7th, 8th, & 9th). So I called them on Dec 10th to make an appt and had scheduled it for the following day, the 11th (Thur). However, my mom wasn't able to take me so we rescheduled for Monday the 15th. On Thursday, I decided to fast and stick with liquids to see if that would help my stomach and intestines. I was doing great until I drank a Mango Madness and ate 1/2 an orange. (Lay off the thick drinks folks!!! Stick with clear fluids when u have appendix issues.) Within 1/2 an hour I was on the toilet letting it all flow out and my strength left me. I could feel the darkness overcoming me and I thought for sure I was going to faint. I was able to wobble my way to the sink where I threw up my entire life. Good times!!🤪 I am so lucky I had my cell phone next to me. Unfortunately, it is only used for wifi, no sim, but I was able to msg my family to let them know i needed to go to the hospital asap. My brother picked me up and we went to the closest ER in the area. We were less than 0.5 miles away when the SUV broke down. (This car has NEVER broken down, it is reliable, never had issues!! 😈) But God was watching out for me and compelled a beautiful soul to do a u-turn to help us out. She actually said she had this feeling/urge to come over and help us... something along those lines. (May the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob bless her richly!!!) She took me to the hospital and went back to help my brother. My parents met up with me at the ER hospital and told me that 3 other people came to the help of my brother. One was a mechanic that told my brother what part needed to be replaced. I don't know who the 3rd person was but the 4th person was someone who was a little buzzed. 😂😂😂 I thought that was pretty funny that even a person under the influence tried to help us. 🙌 I had another CT scan and the Dr said that the bacteria had formed around the hole of the appendix and that I had to go back to the hospital. 😐 So around 2am Friday, I arrived at a different hospital. Had a CT scan at 5pm and that Dr recommended another drain bag 😫. Saturday morning, I think, they attached one on me. Sunday, another CT scan was done, the bacteria was gone and they removed the bag after giving me [nanic? i'll fix this post later w/ correct name]. By 4:30? I was discharged and now I have IV meds through a midline that I am to have once a day 🤗. In a month or two, my appendix will be removed 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳.
I do have prayer requests: There is an older gentleman I met at the ER rm before going to the hospital, please pray for him and his son who drove him there. There were 3 different patients that roomed w/ me while at the hospital: one w/ a gallbladder issue, another one with appendix, and the third with hip pain. Please pray for them. Also, one of the transports has two kids in their teens who live with their mom that isn't a Christian. They stopped going to church a couple of years ago and seem to not believe in Jesus as The Messiah.
I want to especially thank all the prayer warriors who are aware of my situation and The Baptist deacon/pastor who spoke with my parents, that he would pray for me: Much love, that really was a comfort to hear that. 🥰💞   </p>

                <h3>dream - December 14, 2025</h3>
                <p> 
                   I had a pretty cool dream this morning. It was very brief. It was a completely black background with no light, and then brilliant white Hebrew letters started appearing, as if someone was writing them, but there weren't any hands or anything. And someone—a man—was teaching me how to pronounce the words and was speaking to me in Hebrew. I was in the spirit, watching and listening, and suddenly cracked a joke within myself: "The Jew haters are going to lose their mind if this is going to be taught to everyone." And then I was taken out of that dream and woke up. I thought that was pretty cool. Words I haven't learned yet.

                <h3>dream - November 23, 2025</h3>
                <p> 
                   I had a dream that I was holding a hand grenade in my right hand and somehow it was activated. I don't know if it malfunctioned or if I accidentally set it off, but I was in a panic trying to figure out how to deactivate it. [I was switching between 1st person and 3rd person.] I could see myself going through the house trying to find a place where I could put it to minimize the explosion, and as I went back outside to the garage, there was Storm lying down on the garage floor passively watching me, no concern. Her head was up staring at me and I was so surprised to see her, but since I still had the grenade in my hand, I couldn't visit with her. (By this time the grenade had morphed into some odd structure.) There was this steel little box by the front door steps that I put the explosive device in. However, when it went off, the thing imploded on itself and then I woke up with really bad pain on my right side of my lower body. It felt like a kidney stone that was stuck.

                <h3>dream - 2020-21?</h3>
                <p> 
                I had a dream that I was at a park with other Christians. It was an organized event, but I don't know why we were there or the purpose of the event. (I never saw any microphones, stage, or speaking area.) I'm not sure if it was a church-organized event or if it was a Christian-affiliated event. I don't recall seeing myself socializing with anyone at the event. [My dream kept switching from 1st to 3rd person.] The people were in groups on the grass. Some were standing and others sitting. I walked a little distance away from everyone to be on my own, and a man came up to me (3rd person viewing). When he started speaking to me, my dream shifted to a 1st person viewing. Now, somehow I knew that Hibbs was one of the leaders of this event, or maybe the main figure of the event? I'm not sure how I knew that, since I don't recall seeing him in my dream, but I somehow knew he was there and that I was there as his support. (Which is very strange since I don't know the man.) [The man that came up to me, I didn't know him personally, but I somehow knew he was part of the event. I don't know in what capacity he fulfilled the role there, but he was someone that was friends with Hibbs and the organizers. He was someone that people trusted and respected.] So this guy in my dream—he was a white male, about 5'10" and medium built—and he was trying to convince me to usurp Hibbs and to promote him. I honestly can't remember the words that were said by him, but I became angry and started yelling at the guy. At some point I raised my right hand (point of view switched to 3rd person) and index finger to heaven and told him he was going to have the wrath of God upon him if he didn't repent (something along those lines). As I was yelling at him and stepping towards him (I kid you not), lightning from Heaven came down and electrocuted that guy, and then I woke up.

                <h3>dream - 2020</h3>
                <p> I had this dream that I was on a street corner next to a fire hydrant. It reminded me of the gas station where I used to live, by Lakewood, but honestly, it could have been at any corner. I don't know why I was there, but I was standing next to the fire hydrant and it broke. The water was somehow being funneled into an invisible container, which I was inside (but I didn't know I was inside of it). The water quickly rose past my knees, filling up the invisible container, but I couldn't get out of the invisible container. As the container filled, I was completely submerged in water, and the scene shifted to me being in a lake or ocean—more lake than ocean—and no longer in an invisible container. [The dream shifted to 1st person.] I was sinking in the water and I could see the sunlight above the water, so I stuck my hand up hoping someone would see it and grab it, while sinking. (side note, for some reason, I couldn't swim - I didn't even try.) And I saw a hand come through the water and grab my hand. It seemed as if it was the hand of God, but as I was taken out of the water, the hand changed and I saw the smile of Greg Laurie. Then I woke up.
I've always wondered about this dream because I can't imagine it ever coming true.
